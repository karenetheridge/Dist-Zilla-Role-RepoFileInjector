=head1 NAME

Dist::Zilla::Role::RepoFileInjector - Create files outside the build directory

=head1 VERSION

version 0.001

=head1 SYNOPSIS

In your F<dist.ini>:

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This role is to be consumed by any plugin that plans to create files outside
the distribution.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=head2 repo_root

A L<Path::Tiny> directory indicating the base directory where the file(s) are
written, when relative paths are provided. Defaults to the current working directory.

=head2 allow_overwrite

A boolean indicating whether it is permissible for the file to already exist
(whereupon it is overwritten).  When false, a fatal exception is thrown when
the file already exists.

Defaults to true.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 add_repo_file

    $plugin->add_repo_file($dzil_file);

Registers a file object to be written to disk.
If the path is not absolute, it is treated as relative to C<repo_root>.
The file should consume the L<Dist::Zilla::Role::File> role.

=head2 write_repo_files

    $plugin->write_repo_files;

Writes out all files registered previously with C<add_repo_file>. Your plugin
may choose to do this during either the C<AfterBuild> or C<AfterRelease> phase.

=head2 _repo_files

Returns the list of files added via C<add_repo_file>.
